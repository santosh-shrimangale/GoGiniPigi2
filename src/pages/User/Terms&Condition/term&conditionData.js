        these Booking Terms and Conditions: <br class="d-lg-block d-none">
        “App” means the GoGiniPig Customer mobile web application software.<br
            class="d-lg-block d-none">
        “Booking" means a booking made with a particular Treatment or Service Provider

    </p>
    <p> <strong> Introduction and relationship between you, us and third-party
            Partners</strong></p>
    <p>This Website and App are operated by Go Ginipig Limited (t/a GoGiniPig), a
        company registered in England under Company Number 12201976 and whose Registered
        Office is at 1a Albany Road, Stratford-Upon-Avon, Warwickshire, CV37 6PG
        (“GoGiniPig”, "GGP", "us", "we" or "our").</p>
    <p>The Website and App allow you to book and pay for a broad range of Hair, Beauty,
        Aesthetics and Wellness Services provided by our Treatment or Service Providers
        (our “Treatment or Service Providers”). The Services that you book are provided
        by our Treatment or Service Providers and not by us. The provision of the
        Services booked via our Website or App is the responsibility of the Treatment or
        Service Providers which provides them. You will pay for Services via the Website
        or App, your payment will be received by us acting as commercial agent on behalf
        of the Treatment or Service Provider. When we receive payment as commercial
        agent on behalf of the relevant Treatment or Service Provider, our receipt of
        the correct payment will discharge your debt to that Treatment or Service
        Provider.</p>
    <p>The legal implications of this is that when you purchase Services, it will create
        two binding contracts for you:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>a contract between you and GGP (under which GGP has certain
                responsibilities to you in relation to the purchase or booking) (the
                “GGP Contract”). That contract is based on these Booking Terms and
                Conditions; and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>a contract between you and the relevant Treatment or Service Provider in
                respect of the provision or supply of the Services which you book
                through the Website or App (the “Treatment or Service Providers
                Contract”). That contract is subject to certain provisions of these
                Booking Terms and Conditions.</p>
            <p>All Services are offered by GGP on behalf of our Treatment or Service
                Providers. That is, GGP takes and concludes your bookings as a
                commercial agent for the Treatment or Service Providers. Therefore, we
                are not responsible or liable to you for the actual Services that are
                booked through the Website or App and are provided to you by our
                Treatment or Service Providers.</p>
            <p>You should only make a Booking using GGP if you are 18 years of age, or
                older or if you are making a Booking for someone else who is 18 years of
                age, or older.</p>
            <p>Please check these Booking Terms and Conditions each time you wish to
                make a Booking to ensure you understand the terms which will apply to
                your specific Booking.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Orders and how the contract is formed between you and us</strong></p>
    <p>When making a booking through the Website or App, you will place an order for a
        Booking (an “Order”). The booking process allows the Treatment or Service
        Provider a maximum of 16 hours to accept your Booking. Upon receiving a
        confirmation email/text that your Booking has been accepted by the Treatment or
        Service Provider, either a 15% deposit payment or the full payment for your
        Order, whichever option you chose when you placed your Order, will be taken from
        you. For the avoidance of doubt, the 15% deposit will become non-refundable at
        that time. Until your Booking is accepted by the Treatment or Service Provider,
        you are entitled to change your mind and cancel your Booking request. If you
        wish to cancel a Treatment or Service Providers Contract (ie. if you wish to
        cancel a Booking after you have received the Booking Confirmation), please refer
        to the provisions below in relation to the cancellation of a Booking.</p>
    <p>The Treatment or Service Providers Contract will be formed when you receive
        confirmation of your booking (“Booking Confirmation"). Your Booking Confirmation
        is your receipt from GGP.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to withdraw access to GGP and/or cancel any Booking in the
        event that you fail any credit or fraud prevention check or where we reasonably
        suspect fraud or money laundering by you or someone using your account.</p>
    <p><strong>Services</strong></p>
    <p>Our Treatment or Service Providers are under a legal duty to provide Services
        that are in conformity with the relevant Treatment or Service Providers
        Contract.</p>
    <p>All Services shown on the Website or App are subject to availability and any
        description of the Services on the Website or App, which are written by our
        Treatment or Service Providers to the best of their knowledge, are for
        illustrative purposes only and actual Services may vary from those descriptions.
        We require our Treatment or Service Providers to ensure that all information
        provided by them for display on the Website or App is accurate, complete and not
        misleading in any way, but we cannot verify the information which they provide
        to us. It will be each Treatment or Service Provider’s responsibility to ensure
        that their Services listed on the Website or App are available and accurately
        described.</p>
    <p>You will have legal rights as a consumer in the event that the Services are not
        performed with reasonable care and skill or are otherwise not as described.
        Advice about your legal rights is available from your local Citizens' Advice
        Bureau or Trading Standards office. Nothing in these Booking Terms and
        Conditions will affect your legal rights.</p>
    <p>It is your (or the person receiving the Services) sole responsibility when making
        an Order, to ensure that you are compliant with any contraindications which may
        impact upon your ability to receive the Services. In the event that you (or the
        relevant recipient of the Services) fail to disclose any such information to the
        Treatment or Service Provider, neither GGP nor the relevant Treatment or Service
        Provider shall be liable to you (or the recipient of the Services) for any
        injury, loss or damages resulting from the Services that could reasonably have
        been avoided if you (or the recipient of the Services) had disclosed that
        information prior to receiving the Services. In the event that a Treatment or
        Service Provider requires a photograph from you (or from the individual
        receiving the Services) in order to confirm that you are suitable to receive the
        Services, it is your responsibility to ensure that the photograph you provide is
        a true and accurate representation of you (or of the individual who will be the
        recipient of the Services). In the event that a patch test is required in
        respect of the Services, this will be made clear to you when making your Order.
        The Treatment or Service Provider will communicate with you directly in relation
        to the patch test process that is required. The Treatment or Service Provider
        and yourself will be solely responsible for the completion of such patch test
        processes and GGP will have no liability regarding this.</p>
    <p>In the event that you have any special needs, please check the specific Treatment
        or Service details, where we encourage Providers to add information which may
        make their appointment difficult, for some GiniPigs with specific needs.</p>
    <p>Our Treatment or Service Providers shall be entitled to take before and after
        photographs and/or video recordings showing the Services which have been
        provided to you. The Treatment or Service Provider may seek to feature you in
        these photographs and/or video recordings. It is your responsibility to advise
        the Treatment or Service Provider if you do not wish to feature in these
        photographs and/or video recordings, which will only be available to view on the
        Website or on the GGP social channels such as Facebook and Instagram.</p>
    <p>IT IS A KEY REQUIREMENT THAT ALL THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE WHEN MAKING A
        BOOKING IS TRUE AND ACCURATE. OUR TREATMENT OR SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL USE THE
        INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU TO ENSURE THAT YOU ARE SUITABLE FOR THE SERVICES YOU
        HAVE BOOKED AND A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT WITH THE TREATMENT OR SERVICE
        PROVIDER WILL BE FORMED ON THAT BASIS. ANY MISLEADING INFORMATION PROVIDED BY
        YOU, MAY RESULT IN THE SERVICES NOT BEING PROVIDED TO YOU AND NO REFUND BEING
        DUE TO YOU. PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE READ ALL OF THE RELEVANT DOCUMENTATION
        ON THE WEBSITE WHEN MAKING YOUR BOOKING WITH US.</p>
    <p><strong>The Treatment or Service Providers</strong></p>
    <p>The Treatment or Service Providers will be in the process of completing their
        training, portfolios and/or case studies whilst providing our users with
        discounted treatments. Treatment or Service Providers will therefore be able to
        save their portfolio of work to the Website and App for our users to view at
        their convenience. Please speak to the Treatment or Service Provider directly in
        the event that you would rather that they do not showcase the work in which you
        have featured when providing the Services through the Website or App.</p>
    <p>Our Treatment or Service Providers will be at least 18 years of age when
        providing the Services.</p>
    <p><strong>Cancellation Prior to Booking Acceptance</strong></p>
    <p>If you change your mind about a Booking and wish to cancel it <strong> prior to
            it being accepted </strong> by the Treatment or Service Provider, the
        Booking will not be processed, and no money will be taken from you.</p>
    <p><strong>Cancellation more than 36 Hours Before Booking</strong></p>
    <p>If you wish to cancel a Booking more than 36 hours before it is due to commence,
        in the event that you only paid the deposit prior to the cancellation, the
        Booking will be cancelled, and no further money will be due from you and your
        15% deposit will not be repaid to you.</p>
    <p>In the event that you had paid the total amount due for the Booking, you will be
        refunded 85% of the total sum paid with the deposit of 15% not being repaid to
        you.</p>
    <p><strong>Cancellation less than 36 Hours Before Booking</strong></p>
    <p>If you wish to cancel a Booking less than 36 hours before it is due to commence,
        you will not be entitled to any refund.</p>
    <p>In order to cancel your Booking, this should be done through the Website or App
        directly.</p>
    <p><strong>Resolving Issues</strong></p>
    <p>GGP cares about your experience and wants to ensure that we maintain the highest
        standards possible and so if you would like to make a complaint about one of our
        Treatment or Service Providers or their Services, please either:</p>
    <p>(i) speak to the Treatment or Service Provider yourself to try and resolve the
        issue; and/or</p>
    <p>(ii) email us at <a href="mailto:admin@goginipig.com"> admin@goginipig.com</a> or
        write to us at GoGiniPig, 1a Albany Road, Stratford-Upon-Avon, Warwickshire,
        CV37 6PG.</p>
    <p>Following receipt of a complaint we will contact the Treatment or Service
        Provider to try and resolve the issue on your behalf. In the event that we are
        unable to resolve the issue following discussions with the Treatment or Service
        Provider, if we consider it to be fair in all the circumstances, we may at our
        sole discretion elect to:</p>
    <p>1. give you a credit note for the disputed/complained about amount of your
        Booking (to be redeemed on the Website or the App to reduce the purchase price
        of any Services); or</p>
    <p>2. as a last resort or in extreme circumstances and always at our sole
        discretion, refund the disputed/complained about amount directly to you via the
        original method of payment. Please note that it might take up to 30 days to
        receive a full refund in such cases.</p>
    <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT WHILST WE TAKE ALL COMPLAINTS ABOUT OUR TREATMENT OR SERVICE
        PROVIDERS VERY SERIOUSLY AND WILL ALWAYS DO WHAT WE CAN TO HELP TO RESOLVE SUCH
        COMPLAINTS, WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE TO YOU FOR THE SERVICE(S) WHICH THE TREATMENT
        OR SERVICE PROVIDERS PROVIDE AND ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A
        REFUND OR CREDIT NOTE IN THE EVENT YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES WHICH
        YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR TREATMENT OR SERVICE PROVIDERS.</p>
    <p><strong>Price and Payment</strong></p>
    <p>Prices (including any processing charges) will be as quoted on the Website or App
        but may be subject to change by GGP or our Treatment or Service Providers at any
        time (in which case the Website or App will be updated accordingly).</p>
    <p>Payment for all Services must be made at the time of booking in pounds sterling
        by credit or debit card, through our third-party payment provider, Stripe
        ("Payment Facility"). Please note that this Payment Facility is subject to the
        third-party provider’s terms and conditions, privacy policy and other terms. You
        will be responsible for protecting the confidentiality of your Website or App
        user ID and any password or other security information used by you to access
        your account on the Payment Facility. We take reasonable care to ensure that the
        Payment Facility is available and functioning at all times, but cannot guarantee
        continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to such Payment Facility, nor can we
        guarantee that the Payment Facility will be virus or error free. We use
        third-party payment service providers to process payments and because there are
        many factors beyond our control (such as delays in the banking system or in card
        networks), we cannot predict or guarantee the amount of time needed to complete
        the processing of your payment. Access to the Payment Facility may be
        occasionally restricted to allow for repairs, maintenance or the introduction of
        new facilities or services. We will attempt to provide reasonable notice of any
        scheduled interruptions to such Payment Facility and will do what we can to
        restore the facility as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
    <p>GGP will collect the payment, through the Payment Facility, in its capacity as
        the commercial agent of the Treatment or Service Provider. Once GGP has
        successfully received your payment for the Services, this will discharge your
        debt to the Treatment or Service Provider on whose behalf GGP has collected the
        payment.</p>
    <p><strong>Liability</strong></p>
    <p>Where we have been negligent and/or breached a contractual obligation to you, we
        will be liable for any loss or damage you suffer as a result, provided that loss
        and/or damage is reasonably foreseeable. Loss or damage is reasonably
        foreseeable if it is an obvious consequence of our negligence or breach of
        contract or would have been considered by you and us to be a likely consequence
        of it at the time we entered into the GGP Contract.</p>
    <p>We do not accept any liability for the following types of loss, whether caused by
        breach of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, even if the loss
        is foreseeable: loss of income or revenue; loss of business; loss of profits;
        loss of anticipated savings; or waste of management or office time.</p>
    <p>We do not exclude or limit our liability for death or personal injury arising
        from our negligence, for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or for any other
        liability which cannot be excluded or limited under English law.</p>
    <p><strong>Our right to vary these Booking Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
    <p>We may revise these Booking Terms and Conditions from time to time in the
        following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>if we change the process for accepting payment from you;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>if there are changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements; and/or
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>if there are any other changes to our business that reasonably mean we
                need to amend these Booking Terms and Conditions.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every time you make a Booking via the Website or App, the Booking Terms and
        Conditions in force at that time (and available for view on the Website and App
        and accepted by you at check-out) will apply to the GGP Contract between you and
        us and the Treatment or Service Providers Contract between you and the Treatment
        or Service Provider. You can find the date on which these Booking Terms and
        Conditions were last updated at the top of this page.</p>
    <p><strong>General</strong></p>
    <p>Following the completion of the Services, you will be able to leave a public
        review (“Review”) of your Booking and the Services received on the Website and
        will be able to submit a star rating (“Rating”) for such Booking and Services.
        Ratings or Reviews should reflect your opinion. Such Ratings and Reviews will
        not be verified by us for accuracy.</p>

        inappropriate, abusive or otherwise unacceptable towards any of our team or to a
        Treatment or Service Provider, either in communications via phone or email, or
        in person.</p>
    <p>If any of these Booking Terms and Conditions are determined by a competent
        authority to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, such term,
        condition or provision will to that extent be severed from the remaining terms,
        conditions and provisions which will continue to be valid to the fullest extent
        permitted by law.</p>
    <p>These Booking Terms and Conditions will be governed by and construed in
        accordance with the laws of England. You and we each agree that the English
        courts will have non-exclusive jurisdiction over any claim or dispute arising
