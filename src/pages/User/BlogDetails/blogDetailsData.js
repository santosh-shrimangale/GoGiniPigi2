      I do this thing a lot where I have a really yummy non-alcoholic
      drink and then have an inner monolog about how I can add booze to
      it. I kind of do this with everything.

      With all of this triathlon training I’ve been trying to up my
      water intake because the heat kills. I naturally gravitate to
      water, I’m not really one of those people that have soda outside
      of cocktails. One of my favourite ways to up my water intake is by
      infusing.

      I think at this point most people have had spa water and that’s
      the exact thing I infuse 90% of the time in our house. I just love
      that combination of cucumber, mint, and lime together. It’s
      refreshing, light, and satisfying. Which also makes it a lot more
      easier for me to take in the amount of water I need to keep up
      with training and the Texas humidity. Refreshing, Light and
      Satisfying
